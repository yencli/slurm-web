Installation Guide
==================

Download
--------

Source code
^^^^^^^^^^^

The source code of Slurm-web is hosted on GitHub at this URL:
https://github.com/edf-hpc/slurm-web

You can download latest version of this source code by clone the Git repository::

    git clone https://github.com/edf-hpc/slurm-web.git

Debian packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are currently thinking about providing pre-built Debian packages for
Slurm-web ready to download and install. For the moment, you will have to build
these packages by yourself from the source.

On a Debian based system with all build dependencies installed, run the
following command (or any similar) to build the binary packages::

    debuild -us -uc

The packages should build properly, then you can add them to your own internal
Debian repository.

Requirements
------------

For the moment, Slurm-web is developed as a native Debian package. This means it
is very easy to install it and configure it on Debian based GNU/Linux
distributions (eg. Ubuntu).

However, the drawback is that it becomes much harder to install it on others
RPM based GNU/Linux distributions (such as RHEL, Centos, Fedora, and so on).
If you want to improve the situation on these distributions, please contact us.

The backend API depends on the following libraries:

* `Flask`_ web framework,
* `PySLURM`_, the python binding to Slurm C libraries,
* `ClusterShell`_ , a distributed shell with nodeset manipulation Python library

.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/
.. _PySLURM: http://www.gingergeeks.co.uk/pyslurm/
.. _ClusterShell: http://cea-hpc.github.io/clustershell/

The dashboard has the following dependencies:

* `bootstrap`, the responsive HTML, JS and CSS framework,
* `jQuery`_ JS library,
* `Flot`_, a jQuery extension for drawing charts.

.. _bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/
.. _jQuery: https://jquery.com/
.. _Flot: http://www.flotcharts.org/


Installation

^^^^^^^^^^^

Not supported yet. Please contact us if you want to improve this part.

Docker
^^^^^^

To build Slurm-web as a Docker container, you will need to:

1. Clone the git repository
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/edf-hpc/slurm-web.git
   $ cd slurm-web

2. Build the image
""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd docker/container
    $ docker build -t slurm-web .
    $ cd ../..

3. Customize the configuration files
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The container will use configuration files stored in a `conf/` directory (you
can customize the path in the `run.sh` script). You can copy the provided
`run.sh` script and examples in a location of your choice, and start from there:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ WORKDIR=$HOME/slurm-web
   $ mkdir $WORKDIR
   $ cp docker/run/run.sh $WORKDIR/
   $ cp -R conf/ $WORKDIR/
   $ cd $WORKDIR
   ... edit configuration files ...

4. Run the container
""""""""""""""""""""

You may want to edit the `run.sh` script to specify where you stored your
configuration files.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd $WORKDIR
    $ ./run.sh

You can then check that the container is running with `docker ps`, and then
access the Slurm-web interface by pointing your browser to
http://localhost:8081/slurm.

Distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Debian/Ubuntu
"""""""""""""

Once the binary packages of Slurm-web are in your internal Debian repository, simply
install these packages with the following command::

    apt-get install slurm-web-restapi slurm-web-dashboard

RHEL/Centos

Configuration
-------------

The configuration of Slurm-web is composed of a few files, an XML description
of your racks and nodes, a file for the REST API configuration, and some files
for the dashboard configuration.
The content and format of these files is explained in the following
sub-sections.

XML racks and nodes description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Slurm does not provide sufficient information about the nodes and the racks
composing a supercomputer for representing it accurately with correct node sizes
and distribution over the racks. For this purpose, Slurm-web backend API relies
on an additional file located under the path ``/etc/slurm-web/racks.xml``.

This file must contain the complete description of your racks and nodes in XML
format. Here is an example of file:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE rackmap SYSTEM "/usr/share/slurm-web/restapi/schema/dtd/racks.dtd">
    <rackmap>

      <nodetypes>
        <nodetype id="m32x4321" model="Vendor A 32 x4321" height="1" width="0.5" />
        <nodetype id="b43" model="Vendor B 43" height="2" width="1" />
      </nodetypes>

      <racks posx="0" posy="0" width="10" depth="10">
        <racksrow posx="0">
          <rack id="rack1-1" posy="0">
            <nodes>
              <node id="cn001" type="m32x4321" posx="0" posy="2" />
              <node id="cn002" type="m32x4321" posx="0.5" posy="2" />
              <node id="cn003" type="m32x4321" posx="0" posy="4" />

              <nodeset id="cn[004-072]" type="m32x4321" posy="5" />
            </nodes>
          </rack>

          <rack id="rack1-2" posy="1">
            <nodes>
              <node id="cn101" type="m32x4321" posx="0" posy="1" />
              <nodeset id="cn[102-121]" type="m32x4321" posy="5" />
            </nodes>
          </rack>
        </racksrow>

        <racksrow posx="1">
          <rack id="rack2-1" posy="0">
            <nodes>
              <node id="cn201" type="m32x4321" posx="0" posy="3" />
              <node id="cn202" type="m32x4321" posx="0.5" posy="3" />
              <node id="cn203" type="m32x4321" posx="0" posy="4" />

              <nodeset id="cn[204-272]" type="m32x4321" posy="6" />
            </nodes>
          </rack>

          <rack id="rack2-2" posy="1">
            <nodes>
              <node id="cn301" type="b43" posx="0" posy="0" />
              <nodeset id="cn[302-319]" type="b43" posy="5" />
            </nodes>
          </rack>
        </racksrow>
      </racks>
    </rackmap>


The root element of the XML file is ``<rackmap>``. This root element must contain
2 elements: ``<nodetypes>`` and ``<racks>``.

The ``<nodetypes>`` element contains the description of all types of nodes with
their models and sizes. Each type of node is described within a distinct
``<nodetype>`` element with a unique ID (ex: *m32x4321*). This ID will be later
used as a reference of type for nodes. Each node type must have a
``model`` attribute whose content is free text, a ``height`` and a ``width``
whose values must be floats in U unit. For example, a node with a width of 0.5
uses half of rack width. With a height of 2, a node will uses 2 U in rack height.

The organization of the different racks is designed by rows of racks, in order
to generate a 3D view of the room containing the racks composing the supercomputer.

The ``<racks>`` element contains the list of the rows of racks, corresponding to
the ``<racksrow>`` elements. It has these attributes:

- a ``posx`` attribute and  a ``posy`` attribute to set the position of the racks
  inside the room (the origin is corresponding to the center of the 3D view)
- a ``width`` attribute and  a ``depth`` attribute to set the size of the room
- and finally  a ``rackwidth`` attribute to set the width of a rack.

Each ``<racksrow>`` element has a ``posx`` attribute to define the position of
the corresponding row of racks, starting from the left of the screen, and
contains a list of racks, each one being described in a distinct ``<rack>``
element. Each attribute for either ``<racks>`` or ``<racksrow>`` or ``<rack>``
elements use the width of a rack as unit.

Each rack element must have a unique ID which will be then used as rack name. A
rack must have a position in its ``<racksrow>``, within ``posy`` attribute.
These attributes about position must be integer, they represent the rack
position within a grid with all racks. If ``posx`` and ``posy`` attributes are
skipped, then we assume they are equal to ``0``. Two racks should not have the
same positions.

See in the schema below the relation between the parameters and the
corresponding representation of the racks in the 3D view. Parameters for
``<racks>`` element are shown in blue, those for ``<racksrow>`` or ``<rack>``
elements in red.

.. image:: img/racks_positioning_slurm-web.png
   :width: 800px

A rack contains a set of nodes within ``<nodes>`` element as shown in
the previous example. As usual, ``posx`` and ``posy`` attributes are assumed
to be equal to ``0`` if missing. Besides, ``<nodeset>`` elements can have
an attribute ``draw`` which will tell in which direction Slurm-Web
will draw the nodes in the rack (``up`` or ``down``). When missing, it is
set to ``up``.

Here is the rendering of the 2D view according to this example of
``racks.xml``:

.. image:: img/screenshot_racks-2D_rendering_example.*
   :width: 800px

Here is the rendering of the jobsmap view according to this example of
``racks.xml``:

.. image:: img/screenshot_jobsmap_rendering_example.*
   :width: 800px

Here is the rendering of the 3D view according to this example of
``racks.xml``:

.. image:: img/screenshot_racks-3D_rendering_example.*
   :width: 800px

Once you have completely described all the racks and nodes composing your
supercomputer, you can check the file format by validating it against the
provided DTD file with the following command::

    xmllint --valid --noout /etc/slurm-web/racks.xml

User running the REST API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the user running the REST API is set to ``www-data`` in
``/etc/apache2/conf-available/slurm-web-restapi.conf``. If some
resources in your Slurm cluster are accessible to only some of your
users, then Slurm-Web won't show them. Using a user with enough
credentials will fix the problem. Usually, setting the user to ``slurm``
(see *slurm.conf*) is enough.

Virtualhost settings of clusters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Slurm-web dashboard is using apache mod_wsgi. Since REST API requires headers
information. It will be necessary to turn the WSGIPassAuthorization``
directive to ``On`` in virtualhost configuration. The configuration file can
be found in ``/etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl.conf`` of your clusters.

Here is an example of a virtualhost configuration file:

.. code-block:: bash
  <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    <VirtualHost *:443>
      
      ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
      WSGIPassAuthorization On
      DocumentRoot /var/www/html
                  :
                  :

    </VirtualHost>
  </IfModule>

REST API configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the configuration of the REST API is handled in ``conf/restapi.conf``.
Here is an example of a valid configuration file:

.. code-block:: python

  # configure here all parameters for the Slurm-web REST API

  [cors]
  # give here the list of the domains from where the origin is authorized,
  # separated by commas
  #
  # example : authorized_origins = http://example1.com,http://example2.com
  authorized_origins = http://dashboard.myslurmhpc.com

  [config]
  # Set to 'enable' to activate authentication.
  # Authentication is based on LDAP, so an LDAP server and the good configuration
  # for it, below in this file, are required.
  authentication = enable
  # Absolute path to the secret key file.
  secret_key = /etc/slurm-web/secret.key
  # Set to 'enable' to activate cache.
  cache = enable
  # Path for racks description (default to /etc/slurm-web/racks.xml).
  racksxml =

  [roles]
  # Allow guests users or not. Guests users have the 'none' role. Disabled by
  # default.
  guests = disabled

  # The `all` role if for all users that do not either have the user or admin
  # role, including guests. Enabled by default.
  all = enabled

  # The roles members can be defined with a list of groups (whose names
  # are prefixed by @) and logins.
  user = @usergroup,user
  admin = @admingroup,adminuser

  # Give here restricted fields about jobs for each role, separated by commas
  restricted_fields_for_all = command,account
  restricted_fields_for_user = command
  restricted_fields_for_admin =

  [acl]
  # You can set here an access control list for each view of the dashboard for
  # this cluster.
  # This feature requires authentication to be enabled.
  # For each view, you can give a list of roles (prefixed by @) to define who
  # can access to this view.
  # If no ACL is provided for a view, every authenticated user can access to
  # this view.
  # i.e. ``jobs = @admin`` implies that the jobs view will be available only
  # for every user which has role of 'admin'.
  # If you give an empty value for an entry (i.e. ``jobs =``), the corresponding
  # view will not be accessible for anybody.
  #
  # Available views are : [
  #   'jobs', 'jobsmap', 'partitions', 'reservations', 'qos', 'racks', '3dview',
  #   'gantt', 'topology'
  # ]
  jobs = @user,@admin
  gantt = @admin
  3dview =

  [ldap]
  # Configure here settings to connect to your LDAP server.
  uri = ldap://admin:389
  people_base = ou=people,dc=cluster,dc=local
  group_base = ou=group,dc=cluster,dc=local
  #cacert = /etc/ssl/certs/cacert.pem
  expiration = 1296000

  [racks]
  # path for racks description (default to /etc/slurm-web/racks.xml)
  path = /etc/slurm-web/racks.xml

  [cache]
  # address for Redis server (default to host=localhost, port=6379)
  redis_host = localhost
  redis_port = 6379
  # TTL for jobs (default to 10 seconds)
  jobs_expiration = 10
  # TTL for other informations (default to 86400 seconds = 24 hours)
  global_expiration = 86400


CORS
""""

To allow a Slurm-web dashboard to retrieve informations from a Slurm cluster on
a different server than the one where the dashboard is, you can configure the
domain where your dashboard is hosted. The REST API is even able to be polled
from several crossdomain dashboards: just set origins of each dashboard in the
``authorized_origins`` parameter, separated by commas.


Authentication
""""""""""""""

The REST API has an optional authentication feature based on an LDAP directory.
If the parameter ``authentication`` is set to ``enable``, the dashboard will
ask users to give credentials to access the cluster data.

The authentication feature requires a randomly generated secret key file. The
content of this file is used to sign the generated tokens on server-side to
ensure their integrity during network exchanges. The path to the secret key
file is set with the ``secret_key`` parameter in the ``config`` section. The
default path is ``/etc/slurm-web/secret.key``. For security reason, please make
sure only the root and WSGI users have read access to this file and it is not
world-readable.

To generate a secret key file, you can use Linux pseudorandom number generator
with this command::

    head -c 64 /dev/urandom > /etc/slurm-web/secret.key

Then set correct mode and ownerships::

    chown www-data: /etc/slurm-web/secret.key
    chmod 400 /etc/slurm-web/secret.key

The authentication feature also requires the LDAP parameters to be set in the
``[ldap]`` section of the configuration files.

When enabled, the authentication feature handles different roles for the users:

* *user*: this role is for users. The parameter ``user`` accepts a
  list of values to define authorized users either by the group he belongs to,
  or by their login.

* *admin*: this role is for administrators. The parameter ``admin`` works as the
  ``user`` one.

* *all*: this role for all other users who are neither user or admin. When the
  parameter ``all`` is set to ``enabled`` (default), all authenticated users
  can access the REST API. When it is set to ``disabled``, the users without any
  other role cannot access the REST API.

For each role, a corresponding *restricted field* parameter exists to set some
fields about jobs which have to be hidden to the defined users. Just set a list
of the field's name separated by commas.

It is also possible to allow guests users to access the REST API with the
``guests`` paramter (``disabled`` by default). If set to ``enabled``, a new
guest button is added under the login form in the dashboard. The guests users
have the *all* role. Then the *all* role must be enabled as well to allow the
guests users to access the REST API.

Besides the restriction of fields, it is also possible to add restrictions on
jobs or reservations according to one's roles. This restriction can be set by
Private Data from `Slurm <https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html>`_. If
``jobs`` or ``reservations`` are defined previously in Slurm, non-admin users
will not see nobody but their own jobs or reservations. The Jobs View or
Reservations View will be empty if logging as ``guests``.

Cache
"""""

The cache mechanism is used to prevent overloading of slurmctld. It requires the
``python-redis`` package and a running instance of Redis. It is disabled if
``python-redis`` is not available. You can set two different TTL : one for
informations about jobs, the second one for all other informations retrieved on
slurmctld.


Dashboard configuration settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All configuration files for dashboard are in the directory ``conf/dashboard``.

App ``conf/dashboard/config.json``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Used for general purpose.

Basic configuration file :

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "STARTPAGE": "jobs",
    "REFRESH": 30000,
    "MAXNODESLENGTH": 25,
    "AUTOLOGIN": false,
    "LOGOURL": "../static/logo.png"
  }

- *STARTPAGE* (String) : Name of the page loaded at the application startup.

  Default pages available :
    - 3d-view
    - gantt
    - jobs
    - jobs-maps
    - partitions
    - qos
    - racks
    - reservations
    - topology


- *REFRESH* (Number) : Time in milliseconds between two api call, used for module refresh.

- *MAXNODESLENGTH* (Number) : Maximum characters show for the nodes name in "Nodes" column in module Jobs.

- *AUTOLOGIN* (Boolean) : Enable/disable automatic login on all clusters (optionnal: disabled if omitted).

- *LOGOURL* (String) : Define the image url in the top left-hand corner.

- *JOBS_XTRA_COL* (Hash) : Define an additional optional column if the jobs
  view. This parameter is optional. When set, it must contain the following 3
  parameters:

  - *NAME*: The column name
  - *CONTENT*: The HTML content of the cell for each job.
  - *CONDITION*: The job state (eg. `RUNNING`) for which the content of the
    cell is displayed. The cell for jobs in other states in remains empty.
    There is a special value `ALL` for the cell content to be displayed for
    all jobs.

  The content can have special placeholders which are substituted based on the
  context:

  - `{{cluster}}`: the cluster name
  - `{{jobId}}`: the slurm job ID

Here is a full example of a *JOBS_XTRA_COL*:

.. code-block:: json

  "JOBS_XTRA_COL":
  {
   "NAME": "metrics",
   "CONTENT": "<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://metrics.company.tld/{{cluster}}/{{jobId}}\">view</a>",
   "CONDITION": "RUNNING"
  }

This example configures a column whose name is metrics. A link named *view*
appears for all running jobs. This link redirects to an HTTP URL on
*metrics.company.tld* containing the cluster name and the job ID.

Clusters ``clusters.config.json``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Slurm-web Dashboard can retrieve informations from several REST APIs hosted
on different servers. Simply set the address of each one to reach them, like
in the example below :

.. code-block:: js

  [
    {
      "name": "My first cluster",
      "api": {
        "url": "http://myfirstrestapi.myslurmhpc.com",
        "path": "/slurm-restapi"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "My second cluster",
      "api": {
        "url": "http://mysecondrestapi.myslurmhpc.com",
        "path": "/"
      }
    }
  ]

The ``path`` attribute defines the route to the REST API on the server (by
default the REST API is configured to be reached on the route ``/slurm-restapi``
).

If you have only one cluster hosted on the same server than the dashboard, use
an empty array :

.. code-block:: js

  []

Alternative ways to interact with REST API
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

There are several ways to check REST API endpoints. You may use tools like
cURL or the requests module of python to connect to REST API via command line.

Here is an exemple of python script to test with.

.. code-block:: python

     #!/usr/bin/env python

    import requests
    import getpass
    import json

    # session must be used if there's network restriction
    session = requests.Session()
    session.trust_env = False

				# Replace localhost:cluster by URL:port
    baseUrl = "http://localhost:cluster"

    versionUrl = baseUrl + "/version"
    print versionUrl
    versionResponse = session.get(versionUrl)
    print versionResponse
    if versionResponse.ok:
        print versionResponse.content
    else:
        versionResponse.raise_for_status()

    loginUrl = baseUrl + "/login"
    login = raw_input("username: ")
    if login != 'guest':
        pswd = getpass.getpass('Password:')
    headers = {'Accept': 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

    if login == 'guest':
        loginResponse = session.post(
            loginUrl, headers=headers, json={'guest': True})
    else:
        loginResponse = session.post(loginUrl, headers=headers, json={
                                     'login': login, 'password': pswd})

    if loginResponse.ok:
        print loginResponse.content
        userInfos = json.loads(loginResponse.content)
        authHeader = "Bearer " + userInfos['id_token']
        headers = {'Accept': 'application/json',
                   'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': authHeader}
        jobsUrl = baseUrl + "/jobs"
        jobsResponse = session.get(jobsUrl, headers=headers)

        if jobsResponse.ok:
            print jobsResponse.content
        else:
            jobsResponse.raise_for_status()
    else:
        # If response code is not ok, print the resulting http error code with
        # description
        loginResponse.raise_for_status()
